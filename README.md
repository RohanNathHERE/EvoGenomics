# EvoGenomics by Rohan Nath
Welcome to EvoGenomics, Rohan Nath's digital portfolio, which is dedicated to exploring comparative and evolutionary genomics through computational biology. This site showcases my research, projects, and contributions to understanding the genetic foundations of life's diversity. Dive into my work as I uncover the evolutionary mechanisms that shape genomes across species.
