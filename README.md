# EvoGenomics by Rohan Nath
Welcome to EvoGenomics, the digital portfolio of Rohan Nath, dedicated to the exploration of comparative and evolutionary genomics through computational biology. This site showcases my research, projects, and contributions to understanding the genetic foundations of life's diversity. Dive into my work as I uncover the evolutionary mechanisms that shape genomes across species.
