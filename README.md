# EvoGenomics
Welcome to EvoGenomics Explorer, a portfolio dedicated to my work in comparative and evolutionary genomics through the lens of computational biology. Here, you'll find insights into my research on genomic diversity, evolutionary patterns, and the computational methods I employ to unravel the complexities of life's molecular blueprint.
